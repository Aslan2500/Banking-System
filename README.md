# Banking-System
So, this Project would help me to master my Java skills

The idea is to create small Banking program which would have following features:
1) You can add your personal account in the banking system. Account would contain your Name, your personal unique id and your own password
2) Each Account has two wallets - crypto wallet and safe wallet
3) You can deposit money to each wallet separately
4) You can buy crypto to your crypto wallet
5) You can withdraw your money
6) You can delete your account from the system


At each step program asks you to enter your id and password just to make sure that no other person can get access to your money
Program has validation system, so if you would try to enter wrong password, wrong id, try to withdraw more money than in your balance
program would throw an exception.
