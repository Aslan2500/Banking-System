So, this Project would help me to master my Java skills

The idea is to create small program which would have following features:
1) Create bank account (with login and password)
2) Delete account
2) Deposit and withdraw money from his/her account
3) Show balance
/Functionality could be updated/

When someone is trying to create account he would have to Enter his name, id number and password for the account
there could be only one account for each user
I assume that there is no people with the same id

Also, by adding id and password person can delete his/her account in our banking system

For each option customer has to identify himself/herself, so the program could find his/her account in the system
Then, program ask customer to enter password
